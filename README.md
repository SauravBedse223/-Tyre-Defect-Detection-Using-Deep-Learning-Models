**Tyre Defect Detection using Deep Learning**

This project aims to automate the detection of defects in tyres using deep learning models. By employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and pre-trained models such as ResNet50, VGG16, InceptionV3, and others, it classifies tyre images as defective or non-defective, facilitating efficient quality control in manufacturing processes.
